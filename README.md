I'm currently working on behalf of Sii sp. z o.o. at Mercedes-Benz Manufacturing Poland as IT L1 support at the factory in Jawor. Sii provides IT outsourcing services. Upon signing the contract during my probationary period, I had to familiarize myself with the job, but that's not all. I had to sign various agreements, consents, attend trainings, and confirm receipt of equipment.

Coordinating such a process can be quite challenging, especially in an outsourcing setup with the client. Not to mention that some cases can be cyclical and may need additiona sign from time to time. Therefore, I would like to develop an onboarding tool/application that will streamline these actions, making them more transparent and organized. To achieve this, I plan to develop an application based on Python as the backend, and HTML + CSS and JavaScript as the frontend.

Such an application will assist Team Managers in easily deploying employees to various positions without complex processes and the need for often chaotic notes.
